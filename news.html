                        alt="Article image"

                <!-- IMPORTANT: data-full holds the full text -->
                <p class="news-excerpt" data-full="Strengthening workforce readiness among Filipino-Canadian youth and young professionals took a significant step forward as OFCS President Jordg Lemita met with MLA Gavin Dew to discuss a proposed pilot initiative aimed at preparing emerging talent for today’s evolving labour market.

            The proposed Youth & Young Professionals Workforce Readiness Pilot reflects a proactive response to both community and employer needs. While young people possess talent and potential, many face challenges navigating modern hiring systems, digital recruitment processes, and employer expectations.

            At the same time, employers continue to experience staffing gaps and evolving workforce requirements — particularly as immigration policies and reliance on temporary foreign labour continue to shift.
            
            A key insight from the discussion emphasized that the issue is often not a lack of talent, but rather a “translation gap” between potential and employability.
            The pilot program proposes innovative approaches rarely seen locally, including:

            • Reverse hiring panels where youth engage directly with employers
            • Applicant Tracking System résumé simulations
            • Hireability scorecards with personalized feedback
            • Mock recruitment days with real-world evaluation
            • Mentorship opportunities with hiring decision-makers
            • Employer pledges supporting youth hiring pathways
            • Transition models preparing local youth for evolving workforce roles

            The expected outcomes include improved job readiness, stronger talent pipelines, reduced early turnover, and enhanced collaboration between community organizations, employers, and educators.
            MLA engagement is expected to help align the initiative with provincial workforce priorities, youth development programs, and potential funding opportunities.
            As a trusted community organization with strong partnerships, venues, digital infrastructure, and real-world hiring insights, OFCS continues to position itself as a catalyst for workforce development and community empowerment in the Okanagan.
            This initiative reflects a forward-thinking commitment not only to cultural preservation but also to economic participation, leadership development, and future community resilience."></p>

                <!-- IMPORTANT: data-full holds the full text -->
                <p class="news-excerpt" data-full="Recent media engagements provided an opportunity to spotlight important conversations surrounding immigration policies, workforce realities, and the evolving role of Temporary Foreign Workers in Canada.
On January 14, OFCS President Jordg Lemita participated in a television interview addressing recent immigration policy changes affecting Temporary Foreign Workers. The discussion focused on local impacts in communities like Kelowna, employer responsibilities, and the importance of compliance, proactive workforce planning, and transparency in navigating regulatory changes.
These conversations are increasingly important as businesses, workers, and communities adapt to shifting immigration frameworks that directly influence labour markets, economic sustainability, and community integration.
Later, on January 22, another interview explored the Temporary Foreign Worker Program from both employer and community perspectives. The discussion highlighted real-life experiences, practical challenges, and the need for balanced understanding between policy objectives and everyday realities faced by workers and employers.
Media engagements like these help bridge knowledge gaps by translating complex policy discussions into relatable community conversations. They also provide a platform for advocating responsible employment practices, ethical recruitment, and supportive community integration for newcomers.
For OFCS, participating in public dialogue aligns with its broader mission: ensuring Filipino Canadians are informed, supported, and empowered while contributing positively to Canada’s social and economic fabric.

                <p class="news-excerpt" data-full="Filipino community leaders from across British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories gathered virtually for the first Online Town Hall organized by the Philippine Consulate General, creating a valuable platform for dialogue, collaboration, and forward-looking initiatives for Filipino communities in Western Canada.
Representing the Okanagan Filipino Canadian Society (OFCS), President Jordg Lemita participated in discussions focused on programs supporting Filipino Canadians, Temporary Foreign Workers, international students, and community organizations navigating evolving social and economic landscapes.
Several promising initiatives were introduced during the session, highlighting the Consulate’s commitment to strengthening connections with Filipino communities while expanding services and outreach efforts.
One of the most anticipated developments is the upcoming Consular Outreach scheduled for May 30–31, expected to provide accessible government services closer to Filipino residents in the Interior region. This initiative reflects the Consulate’s recognition of the growing Filipino population outside major urban centers and its commitment to inclusive service delivery.
The Town Hall also emphasized collaboration between community organizations, employers, and government partners to address emerging needs — from immigration guidance to cultural engagement and workforce support.
For OFCS, participation in discussions like these reinforces its ongoing role as a bridge between community members and institutions, ensuring that local voices are represented while opportunities for support and partnership continue to expand.
As Filipino communities grow throughout Western Canada, initiatives like these strengthen connection, empowerment, and shared progress.

Representing OFCS, President Jordg Lemita attended the church gathering to personally receive the contribution and express heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the Filipino-Canadian community. The moment was marked not just by generosity, but by a shared understanding that humanitarian support transcends borders, cultures, and geography.
Natural disasters continue to impact vulnerable communities worldwide, and this donation serves as a reminder of how local action can create meaningful global impact. The funds will be allocated thoughtfully toward relief efforts that prioritize essential needs and long-term recovery support.
Transparency and responsible stewardship remain central to OFCS’ mission. The organization is committed to ensuring that contributions are distributed responsibly and that donors and community members remain informed about how assistance is delivered.
Beyond financial assistance, the gesture symbolizes unity, empathy, and the enduring spirit of bayanihan — the Filipino value of communal support and cooperation. It reflects how diverse communities in the Okanagan continue to stand together in times of need.
OFCS extends its sincere appreciation to the Church of the Nazarene congregation for their trust, generosity, and solidarity.

                data-fulltext="Kelowna, BC — Jordg Lemita, President of the Okanagan Filipino-Canadian Society (OFCS), recently appeared on OMNI Filipino to discuss the growing number of Temporary Foreign Workers (TFWs) leaving Canada due to recent federal immigration policy changes.
                During the interview, Lemita shared that an estimated 400 TFWs in the Okanagan have either returned home or are preparing to leave within the past six months, reflecting the federal government’s move to reduce the temporary resident population to below 5% of Canada’s total population.
                From an employer perspective, Lemita explained that work permit renewals have become more difficult due to government caps, LMIA limitations, and rising regional unemployment. Employers are now informing workers six to eight months before permit expiry to allow time for planning. He also noted that some workers are exploring alternative pathways, including learning French to qualify for Francophone mobility opportunities outside Quebec.
                Lemita acknowledged the emotional impact of these changes on workers and their families, many of whom viewed employment in Canada as a long-term pathway toward permanent residence and citizenship. He emphasized that most workers are actively researching their options and preparing responsibly.
                When asked about undocumented work, Lemita described the topic as sensitive and stressed the importance of maintaining legal status, advising workers to avoid illegal employment and return home if no lawful pathway is available.
                Addressing the broader policy goal of reducing TFW numbers, Lemita said the move could create more opportunities for local workers but warned of potential productivity losses, especially as experienced employees depart. He highlighted that Filipino workers are globally sought after for their strong work ethic, reliability, adaptability, and service-oriented mindset—qualities employers deeply value.
                Lemita concluded by outlining OFCS’s focus on youth and young professional workforce development, including programs designed to prepare local talent to meet employer expectations as immigration pathways continue to tighten."

            The organizers emphasized that Sinulog is a cultural and religious celebration honoring the Sto. Niño, symbolizing faith, hope, and gratitude. They highlighted the importance of celebrating Sinulog in Kelowna as a way to preserve Filipino identity, strengthen faith, and bring the community together, especially for younger Filipino-Canadians.
            They also shared that this year’s celebration will feature Holy Mass, traditional Sinulog dance, music, and fellowship, welcoming both Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike. First-time attendees can expect a family-friendly, faith-centered, and culturally rich experience.
            Above all, the organizers stressed that Sinulog is not just a festival, but a reminder of bayanihan, unity, and shared devotion, inviting everyone in the community to come together and celebrate as one.
